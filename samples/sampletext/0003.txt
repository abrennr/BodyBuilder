                         LETTER.

To THE HoN. DANIEL WEBSTER.
                                         Pittsburgh, July 4, 1833.
  SIt,--At a meeting of the citizens of Pittsburgh, the undersigned were
appointed a Committee to convey to you a cordial welcome and an assur-
ance of the exalted sense, which is entertained of your character and public
services.
  The feeling is one which pervades our whole community, scorning any
narrower discrimination than that of lovers of our sacred Union, and ad-
mirers of the highest moral and intellectual qualities, steadily and trium-
phantly devoted to the noblest purposes.
  The resolutions, under which the Committee act, indicate no particular
form of tribute, but contain only an earnest injunction to seek the best
mode, by which to manifest the universal recognition of your claim to the
admiration and gratitude of every American citizen. It will be deeply
mortifying to us, if our execution of this trust shall fail adequately to
represent the enthusiastic feeling in which it had its origin.
  The Committee will have the honor of waiting on you in person at such
an hour as you may please to designate, with a view to ascertain how they
can best fulfil the purposes of their appointment. It will be very gratifying
if your convenience will permit you to partake of a Public Dinner at any
period during your stay.
                       We have the honor to be,
                           With the highest respect,
           JAMES ROSS,                  RICHARD BIDDLE,
