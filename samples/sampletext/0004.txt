                                           Pittsburgh, July 5th, 1833.
  GENTLEMEN,-I hardly know how to express my thanks for the hospita-
ble and cordial welcome, with which the citizens of Pittsburgh are disposed
to receive me, on this my first visit to their city. The terms, in which you
express their sentiments in your letter of yesterday, far transcend all merits
of mine, and can have their origin only in spontaneous kindness and good
feeling. I tender to you, gentlemen, and to the meeting which you repre-
sent, my warmest acknowledgements. I rejoice sincerely, to find the
health of the city so satisfactory; and I reciprocate with all the people of
Pittsburgh, the most sincere and hearty good wishes for their prosperity and
happiness. Long may it continue what it now is, an abode of comfort
and hospitality, a refuge for the well-deserving from all nations, a model
of industry, and an honor to the country.
  It is my purpose, gentlemen, to stay a day or two among you, to see such
of your manufactories and public institutions, as it may be in my power to
visit. I most respectfully pray leave to decline a public dinner; bhit shall
have great pleasure in meeting such of your fellow-citizens as may desire
it, in the most friendly and unceremonious manner.
             I am, Gentlemen,
                    With very true regard,
                         Yours,               DANIEL WEBSTER.
To Hon. JAMEs Ross and others,
  Gentlemen of the Committee.
