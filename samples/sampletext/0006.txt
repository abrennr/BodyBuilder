value.   And hence the preciousness of that admirable and
unanswerable exposition, which has put down, once and forever,
the artful sophisms of Nullification.
   " If, gentlemen, we turn to other portions of the public history
of our distinguished guest, it will be found, that his claims to
grateful acknowledgement, are not less imposing. The cause of
Domestic Industry, of Internal Improvement, of Education, of
whatever, in short, is calculated to render us a prosperous, united,
and happy people, has found in him a watchful and efficient
advocate. Nor is it the least of his merits, that, to our gallant
Navy, Mr. Webster has been an early, far-sighted, and persever-
ing friend.   Our interior position cannot render us cold and
unobservant on this point, whilst the victory of Perry yet supplies
to us a proud and inspiring anniversary. And such is the won-
derful chain of mutual dependence which binds our Union, that,
in the remotest corner of the west, the exchangeable value of
every product must depend on the security with which the ocean
can be traversed.
  " Gentlemen, I have detained you too long ; yet I will add one
word. I do but echo the language of the throngs thal have
crowded round Mr. Webster, in declaring, that the frank and
manly simplicity of his character and manners, has created a
feeling of personal regard which no mere intellectual ascendancy,
could have secured. We approached him with admiration for the
achievements of his public career-never supposing, for a
moment, that our hearts could have aught to do in the matter ;
we shall part, as from a valued friend, the recollections of whose
virtues cannot pass away."
