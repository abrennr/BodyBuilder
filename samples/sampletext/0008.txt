 by the Connecticut or the Merrimac. As citizens,
 countrymen, and neighbors, I give you my hearty
 good wishes, and thank you, over and over again, for
 your abundant hospitality.
   Gentlemen, the Mayor has been pleased to advert,
 in terms beyond all expectation or merit of my own,
 to my services in defence of the glorious Constitu-
 tion under which we live, and which makes you and
 me all that we are, and all that we desire to be.
He has done much more than justice to my efforts;
but he has not overstated the importance of that occa-
sion, in which those efforts were made.
   Gentlemen, it is but a few short months, since
 dark and portentous clouds did hang over our heav-
 ens, and did shut out, as it were, the sun in his
 glory. A new and perilous crisis was upon us.
 Dangers, novel in their character, and fearful in their
 aspect, menaced both the peace of the country and
 the integrity of the Constitution. For forty years
 our government had gone on, I need hardly say how
 prosperously and gloriously, meeting, it is true, with
 occasional dissatisfaction, and, in one or two instan-
 ces, with ill-concerted resistance to law. Through
 all these trials it had successfully passed. But now
 a time had come, when the authority of law was
 opposed by authority of law,-when the power of
 the General Government was resisted by the arms
 of State Government, and when organized military
 force, under all the sanctions of State Conventions,
 and State Laws, was ready to resist the collection
 of the public revenues, and hurl defiance at the Stat-
 utes of Congress.
