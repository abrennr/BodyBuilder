 I know it may be said, in regard to the laws of the
 last session, that if such laws are. to be maintained,
 Congress may pass what laws they please, and en-
 force them. But, may it not be said, on the other
 side, that if a state may nullify one law, she may
 nullify any other law also; and, therefore, that the
principle strikes at the whole power of Congress ?
And when it is said, that if the power of state inter-
position be denied, Congress may pass and enforce
what laws it pleases, is it meant to be contended or
insisted, that the Constitution has placed Congress

Congress, from the possibility of its abuse, ,entirely
forget, that if the power of state interposition be
allowed, that power may be abused, also; but, what
is more material, they forget the will of the People,
as they have plainly expressed it in the Constitution;
they forget that the People have chosen to give Con-
gress a power of legislation, independent of state con-
trol; they forget that the confederation has ceased,
