out diminution, by one jot or tittle. For the same
reason that I would not grasp at powers, not given,
I would not surrender nor.abandon powers, which are
given. Those who have placed me in a public sta-
tion, placed me there, not to alter the Constitution,
but to administer it. ·The power of change, the Peo-
ple have retained to" themselves. They can alter,
they can modify, they can change the Constitution
entirely, if they see fit. They can tread it under
foot, and make another, or make no other; but while
it remains unaltered by the authority of the People,
it is our power of attorney-our letter of credit-our
credentials; and we are to follow it, and obey its in-
junctions, and maintain its just powers, to the best of
our abilities. I repeat, that for one, I seek to pre-
serve to the Constitution those precise powers, with
which the People have clothed it. While no en-
croachment is to be made, on the reserved rights of
the People or .of the states, while .nothing is to be
usurped, it is equally clear that we are not at liberty
to surrender, either in fact or form, any power or
principle which the Constitution does actually con-
tain.
   And what is the ground for this cry of consolida-
 tion ? I maintain that the measures recommended
 by the President and adopted by Congress, were
 measures of self-defence. Is it consolidation to ex-
 ecute laws ? Is it consolidation to resist the force
 that is threatening to upturn our government ? Is it
 consolidation to protect officeis in the discharge of
 their duty, from courts and juries previously sworn to
 decide against them ?
