ployments. This is not, in a society like this, a
matter which affects the interest of a particular class,
but one which affects the interest of all classes. It
runs through the whole chairt of human occupation
and employment, and touches the means of living and
the comfort of all.
   Gentlemen, those of you who may have turfied
your attention to the subject know, that, in the quar-
ter of the country with which I am more immediately
connected, the People were not early or eager to
urge the Government to carry the protecting policy
to the height which it has reached. Candor obliges
me to remind you, that, when the Act of 1824 was
passed, neither he who now addresses you, nor those
with whom he usually acted on such subjects, were
ready or willing to take the step which that act pro-
posed. They doubted its expediency. It passed,
however, by the great and overwhelming influence
of the central states, New-York, Pennsylvania, and
Ohio. New-England acquiesced in it. She con-
formed to it, as the settled policy of the country, and
gave to her capital and her labor a corresponding di-
rection. She has now become vitally interested in
the preservation of the system. Her prosperity is
identified, not perhaps with any particular degree of
protection, but with the preservation of the principle;
and she is not likely to consent to yield the principle,
under any circumstances whatever. And who would
dare to yield it ? Who, standing here and looking
round on this community and its interests, would be
bold enough to touch the spring, which moves so
much industry, and produces so much happiness ?
