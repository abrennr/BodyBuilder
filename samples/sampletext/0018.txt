Who would shut up the mouths of these vast Coal
Pits ? Who stay the cargoes of manufactured goods,
now floating down a river, one of the noblest in the
world, and stretching through territories, almost

sustain a competition with that of the over-peopled
countries of Europe, would lead to a state of things,
to which the people could never submit. This is the

and circumstances of the great body of the people;
for nine-tenths of the whole people belong to the
laborious, industrious, and productive classes; and
on these classes the stimulus acts. We perceive that
