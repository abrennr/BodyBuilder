the price of labor is high, and we know that the
means of living are low; and these two truths speak
volumes, in favor of the general prosperity of the
country. I am aware, as has been said already, that
this high price of labor results partly from the favor-

countries, and inquire a little into the causes, which,
in some of them, produce poverty and distress, the
lamentations of which reach our own shores. I see
around me many whom I know to be emigrants from
other countries. Why are they here? Why is the
native of Ireland among us ? Why has he abandon-

rivers are to you? Is there any other cause than

and the low reward of labor on the other, left him
without the means of a comfortable subsistence, or

his own land, and sought an asylum in a country of
free laws, of comparative exemption from taxation,
of boundless extent, and in which the means of living
are cheap, and the prices of labor just and adequate ?
And do not these remarks apply, with more -or less
accuracy, to every other part of Europe?  Is it not
true, that sobriety, and industry, and good character
