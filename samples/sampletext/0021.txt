people, only where there are adequate rewards to
labor and industry, and some share in the public
interest, some stake in community, would seem in-

badly paid. Who would be safe, in any community,
where political power is in the hands of the many,
and property in the hands of the few ? Indeed, such

the world, that it is necessary to protect the industry
of this country, against the pauper labor of England,
and other parts of Europe. An American citizen,
whohas children to maintain, and children to educate,

whose children are not to be educated, and are prob-

fed and clothed by his own labor, and half from the
poor-rates, and vyjr badly fed and clothed after all.
As I have already said, the condition of our country,
of itself, without the aid of Government, does much
to favor American manual labor; and it is a question
of policy and justice, at all times, what and how
